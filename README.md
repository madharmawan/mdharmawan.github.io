This is the place where I will be making a website about college. Some possible branches that this website can take in the future
  - Place for course evaluations, overview of topics
  - Place for uploading my personal projects that are not from any particular class (like from internships, extracurriculars, personal projects)
  - Place for uploading tutoring resources (like if I do TA for a CS class or do CSM). 
  - Blog?
